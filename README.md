Really Simple Grid System

RSGS creates a very simple responsive grid system using a Compass and Sass mixin. 
You can create grids of any size up to Twenty Four Columns for.

Grids can be nested as much as you like and cells centered or pulled to the end of each row.

In addition you can turn on the debug variable to get a visual view of your grid.
